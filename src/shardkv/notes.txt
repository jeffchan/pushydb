- periodically check for new config in tick()
- gob.register args
- return ErrWrongGroup if incorrect shard server called
- ErrWrongGroup should only return if all holes in log filled
- replicas need to share key values with each other during reconfig
- process reconfigs in order
- need to call px.Done
- need to also share client state/dup table -- probably not a good idea to simply just "replace" table
- ErrWrongGroup shouldn't be in dup table, shouldn't change seq number (?)
- when should giving shards happen?
- don't have to delete old shares after reconfig
- can assume " the group containing the shard to be transfered is always available"
- "It might be cleaner for all groups to go through all reconfigurations than skipping reconfigurations for servers whose assigned shards doesn't change."
