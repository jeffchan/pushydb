- periodically check for new config in tick()
- gob.register args
- return ErrWrongGroup if incorrect shard server called
- ErrWrongGroup should only return if all holes in log filled
- replicas need to share key values with each other during reconfig
- process reconfigs in order
- need to call px.Done
- need to also share client state/dup table -- probably not a good idea to simply just "replace" table
- ErrWrongGroup shouldn't be in dup table, shouldn't change seq number (?)
- when should giving shards happen?
- don't have to delete old shards after reconfig
- can assume " the group containing the shard to be transfered is always available"
- "It might be cleaner for all groups to go through all reconfigurations than skipping reconfigurations for servers whose assigned shards doesn't change."
- can't skip configurations (newconfig.Num - oldconfig.Num == 1)
- what about a new replica that joins? need to transfer all that stuff

Reconfig:
insert reconfiguration in paxos log
reconfiguration has oldconfig + newconfig
replicas apply apply apply, see there's a reconfig, block

replica #0 from group A requests from replica #0 of group B
Request {
	ConfigNum
}
Reply {
	KV
	Reqs
}

what happens when you apply
- find out what changed from Old.Shards to New.Shards
-- [0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1]
-- [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]
	if Old.Shards[i] != New.Shards && New.Shards[i] == kv.gid {
		// request kv table from Old.Groups[Old.Shards[i]]
		// what about dup req table?
		// just replace with any existing value?
		// ReconfigOp {
			OldConfig
			NewConfig
			GID
		}
